Sure! Here's a clear README.md you can use for your Rust JWKS JWT validator project:

# Rust JWT Validator with JWKS Support

This project demonstrates how to validate JWT tokens signed with RSA keys fetched dynamically from a JWKS endpoint in Rust using Actix Web.

---

## Features

- Fetch JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) from a remote HTTP endpoint
- Select the correct public key by `kid` from JWT header
- Verify JWT signature using `jsonwebtoken` crate
- Validate standard claims: `sub`, `aud`, `iss`, `exp`
- Simple Actix Web endpoint `/secure` that requires a valid JWT bearer token

---

## Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed: https://rustup.rs/
- A running JWKS server exposing keys at: `http://localhost:3000/.well-known/jwks.json`
- A JWT token signed with a private key matching the JWKS public keys

---

## Running the JWKS Mock Server

If you don't have a JWKS server, you can run a simple Node.js mock server:

1. Initialize project and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm install express jose
````

2. Create `server.js` with JWKS serving logic (example in your project folder).

3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

It will expose JWKS at `http://localhost:3000/.well-known/jwks.json`.

## Running the Rust JWT Validator Server

1. Clone this repository (or create your Rust project):

   ```bash
   git clone <your_repo_url>
   cd rust_authenticator
   ```

2. Make sure your `Cargo.toml` has dependencies:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   actix-web = "4"
   serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
   serde_json = "1"
   jsonwebtoken = "9.3.1"
   reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
   tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
   base64 = "0.21"
   ```

3. Run the Rust server:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

You should see:

```
Server running at http://localhost:8080
```

---

## Testing the `/secure` Endpoint

Send an HTTP GET request with the JWT token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/secure \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>"
```

* Replace `<YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>` with a valid JWT string signed with the private key corresponding to the JWKS.
* If the token is valid, you will get a JSON response of the claims.
* If invalid or missing, you'll get `401 Unauthorized` with an error message.
